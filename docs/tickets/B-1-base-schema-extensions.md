# [EPIC B] Database & RLS â€” [TICKET] Base Schema & Extensions

## Summary
Create the core database schema with all required tables, enums, indexes, and PostgreSQL extensions for the marketplace platform.

- [ ] Set up outbox table for event sourcing
- [ ] Configure proper data types and constraints

## Definition of Done
- All migrations run successfully
- Database schema matches requirements
- Indexes are properly created and optimized
- Extensions are enabled and functional
- Schema is documented with comments
- Migration rollback scripts work

## Tech Notes
- Use UUIDs for all primary keys
- Implement proper foreign key constraints
- Use PostGIS geometry types for location data
- Set up proper indexes for performance
- Include audit fields (created_at, updated_at)
- Use appropriate data types for each field
- Consider partitioning for high-volume tables
